<h1>Getting Started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Python is the fastest way to get started with embedded software on Raspberry Pi Pico. This book is about the official
MicroPython port for RP2040-based microcontroller boards.
MicroPython is a Python 3 implementation for microcontrollers and small embedded systems. Because MicroPython is
highly efficient, and RP2040 is designed with a disproportionate amount of system memory and processing power for
its price, MicroPython is a serious tool for embedded systems development, which does not compromise on
approachability.
For exceptionally demanding pieces of software, you can fall back on the SDK (covered in Getting started with
Raspberry Pi Pico and Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK), or an external C module added to your MicroPython firmware, to
wring out the very last drop of performance. For every other project, MicroPython handles a lot of heavy lifting for you,
and lets you focus on writing the code that adds value to your project. The accelerated floating point libraries in
RP2040’s on-board ROM storage are used automatically by your Python code, so you should find arithmetic
performance quite snappy.
Most on-chip hardware is exposed through the standard machine module, so existing MicroPython projects can be ported
without too much trouble. The second processor core is exposed through the _thread module.
RP2040 has some unique hardware you won’t find on other microcontrollers, with the programmable I/O system (PIO)
being the prime example of this: a versatile hardware subsystem that lets you create new I/O interfaces and run them at
high speed. In the rp2 module you will find a comprehensive PIO library which lets you write new PIO programs at the
MicroPython prompt, and interact with them in real time, to develop interfaces for new or unusual pieces of hardware
(or indeed if you just find yourself wanting an extra few serial ports).
MicroPython implements the entire Python 3.4 syntax (including exceptions, with, yield from, etc., and additionally async
/await keywords from Python 3.5). The following core datatypes are provided: str (including basic Unicode support),
bytes, bytearray, tuple, list, dict, set, frozenset, array.array, collections.namedtuple, classes and instances. Builtin modules
include sys, time, and struct, etc. Note that only a subset of Python 3 functionality is implemented for the data types and
modules.
MicroPython can execute scripts in textual source form (.py files) or from precompiled bytecode, in both cases either
from an on-device filesystem or “frozen” into the MicroPython executable.</p>

<h2>Getting MicroPython for RP2040<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-micropython-for-rp2040" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The fastest way to get MicroPython is to download the pre-built release binary from the Pico Getting Started pages. If
you can’t or don’t want to use the pre-built release — for example, if you want to develop a C module for
MicroPython</p>

<h2>Installing MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-micropython-on-raspberry-pi-pico" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Raspberry Pi Pico has a BOOTSEL mode for programming firmware over the USB port. Holding the BOOTSEL button
when powering up your board will put it into a special mode where it appears as a USB Mass Storage Device. First make sure your Raspberry Pi Pico is not plugged into any source of power: disconnect the micro USB cable if plugged in, and
disconnect any other wires that might be providing power to the board, e.g. through the VSYS or VBUS pin. Now hold
down the BOOTSEL button, and plug in the micro USB cable (which hopefully has the other end plugged into your
computer).
A drive called RPI-RP2 should pop up. Go ahead and drag the MicroPython firmware.uf2 file onto this drive. This
programs the MicroPython firmware onto the flash memory on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
It should take a few seconds to program the UF2 file into the flash. The board will automatically reboot when finished,
causing the RPI-RP2 drive to disappear, and boot into MicroPython.
By default, MicroPython doesn’t do anything when it first boots. It sits and waits for you to type in further instructions.
Chapter 2 shows how you can connect with the MicroPython firmware now running on your board. You can read on to
see how a custom MicroPython firmware file can be built from the source code.
The Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico book has detailed instructions on getting your Raspberry Pi Pico into
BOOTSEL mode and loading UF2 files, in case you are having trouble. There is also a section going over loading ELF
files with the debugger, in case your board doesn’t have an easy way of entering BOOTSEL, or you would like to debug a
MicroPython C module you are developing.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you are not following these instructions on a Raspberry Pi Pico, you may not have a BOOTSEL button. If this is the
case, you should check if there is some other way of grounding the flash CS pin, such as a jumper, to tell RP2040 to
enter the BOOTSEL mode on boot. If there is no such method, you can load code using the Serial Wire Debug
interface</p>

<h2>Building MicroPython From Source<a class="headerlink" href="#building-micropython-from-source" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The prebuilt binaries on the Pico Getting Started pages should serve most use cases, but you can build your own
MicroPython firmware from source if you’d like to customise its low-level aspects</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to create a pico directory to keep all pico-related checkouts in. These instructions create a pico directory
at /home/pi/pico.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>$ cd ~/
$ mkdir pico
$ cd pico</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Then clone the micropython git repository. These instructions will fetch the latest version of the source code.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>$ git clone -b master <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git">https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Once the download has finished, the source code for MicroPython should be in a new directory called micropython. The
MicroPython repository also contains pointers (submodules) to specific versions of libraries it needs to run on a
particular board, like the SDK in the case of RP2040. We need to explicitly fetch these too:</p>
<p>..note:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The following instructions assume that you are using a Raspberry Pi Pico. Some details may differ if you are building
firmware for a different RP2040-based board. The board vendor should detail any extra steps needed to build
firmware for that particular board. The version we’re building here is fairly generic, but there might be some
differences like putting the default serial port on different pins, or including extra modules to drive that board’s
hardware.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To build the RP2040 MicroPython port, you’ll need to install some extra tools. To build projects you’ll need CMake, a
cross-platform tool used to build the software, and the GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm, which turns MicroPython’s C
source code into a binary program RP2040’s processors can understand. build-essential is a bundle of tools you need
to build code native to your own machine — this is needed for some internal tools in MicroPython and the SDK. You can
install all of these via apt from the command line. Anything you already have installed will be ignored by apt.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi build-essential</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>First we need to bootstrap a special tool for MicroPython builds, that ships with the source code:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>$ make -C mpy-cross</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We can now build the port we need for RP2040, that is, the version of MicroPython that has specific support for our
chip.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>$ cd ports/rp2
$ make</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If everything went well, there will be a new directory called build (ports/rp2/build relative to the micropython directory),
which contains the new firmware binaries. The most important ones are:</p>
<p><em>firmware.uf2 A</em> - A UF2 binary file which can dragged onto the RPI-RP2 drive that pops up once your Raspberry Pi
Pico is in BOOTSEL mode. The firmware binaries you will find on Pico Getting Started pages are
UF2 files, because they’re the easiest to install.</p>
<p><em>firmware.elf</em> - A different type of binary file, which can be loaded by a debugger (such as gdb with openocd) over
RP2040’s SWD debug port. This is useful for debugging either a native C module you’ve added to
MicroPython, or the MicroPython core interpreter itself. The actual binary contents is the same
as firmware.uf2.</p>
